          *** Added all the bugs and debugging techniques used in the App ***   

1. Adding Fuse.js for optimized search filtering and NLP like behaviour
   -Debug : There was a broken package and dependency in package.json
            Fixed it using : npm i fuse.js@3.4.3 / npm install --save fuse.js

   2. Module not found: Can't resolve '../styles/jumbotron'
      - Import the folder properly

   3. Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. 
   You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
   - This was because I only created Jumbotrom class and not the contaniner. I will have to make it
   - Debug :Created Jumbotron.Container in jumbotron/index.js . Import Container from styles
