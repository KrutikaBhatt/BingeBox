                 ** Testing Work ** 

A. Testing setup
In package.json :

1 . Create the jest array and enter the root directory
    Enter the coverage Threshold and coverage Reporters in the jest itself

2. Errors while testing : <Login_Form /> â€º renders the <Login_Form /> with populated data

    ForwardRef(Link)(...): Nothing was returned from render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing, return null.
